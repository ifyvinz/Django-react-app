Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Solution
hen creating a list in the UI from an array with JSX, you should add a key prop to each child and to any of itsâ€™ children.

Ex: <li key="uniqueId1" >Item1</li>

React uses the key prop create a relationship between the component and the DOM element. The library uses this relationship to determine whether or not the component should be re-rendered.
